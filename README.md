# Task1
preprocessed_data.zip is the dataset file which i have cleaned and prepared the new data 
the link to the original dataset is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/inventory-analysis-case-study"

i)I first of all extracted the dataset from the xip file i downloaded from kaggle 
ii) Then it has 5 different csv files  in it so i merged all the files combined to get a single dataset to work on
iii) which is have uploaded in preprocessed_data.zip file 
iv) then i took care of missing values and duplicate values 
v) using drop function i removed the rows containing the null values 
vi) then i checked my dataset to see the things i have to actually work upon then i saw there were 2 colums with same functionality 
vii) the columns name were "SIZE" and "VOLUME" so i deleted one of the column 
thats how i preprocessed my data performing data cleaning operations
